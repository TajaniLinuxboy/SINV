SINV Token: Building a Sustainable Governance & Yield-Generating Ecosystem on XRPL EVM Sidechain

## Project Overview:
- Traditional cryptocurrencies often lack guaranteed returns and rely heavily on speculative gains. SINV addresses this by offering a stable, rewarding ERC20 Token built on the XRPL EVM Sidechain. SINV's Governance based ecosystem will provide consistent value to holders through liquidity pools, lending protocols, and RWAâ€™s

## Objective:
- SINV aims to redefine cryptocurrency ownership by offering tangible returns and fostering a stable, rewarding ecosystem for its holders. The mission is to move beyond speculative gains by providing passive income through various investments made on the holders vote
